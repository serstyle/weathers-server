## WeatherApp

A simple web app which let users to search for the weather of a city. They can also create an account with the city of their choice and it would show the weather of this city.

The front end is deploy on netlify and the back end on heroku.

**Live on :** https://weather-app1337.netlify.com/

**backend repo :** https://github.com/serstyle/weather-app

## What techs I used 

- React and Redux(tiny bit) for the front end
- Jest and Enzyme as unit test
- Node Js and Express for the backend
- PostgreSQL as databases
- CircleCI for continuous integration
- Use Open Weather API https://openweathermap.org/api
